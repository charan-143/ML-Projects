##### Using K-means clustering Algorithm

# k means Clustering 
K-Means Clustering is an Unsupervised Learning algorithm, which groups the unlabeled dataset into different clusters. Here K defines the number of pre-defined clusters that need to be created in the process, as if K=2, there will be two clusters, and for K=3, there will be three clusters, and so on. It divides data into clusters without any training. It is a centroid-based algorithm.

## Problem statement 
A famous mall wants to have insights of their customers. To develop their customer strategies and business model. Develop a machine learning model which clusters the existing customers into different categories based on annual income and spending rate so that the mall can strategize according to the customers.


## Tech


- Jupyter Notebook - Editor for analysis
- Kaggle - Datasets


## Modules

```sh
numpy 
pandas 
matplotlib
seaborn 
sklearn
```

# Solution 
The customer segmented into 5 clusters according to their Annual income and spending rates.Now the mobile can make special offers for cluster of customers Who has less spending and a high income to attract them.
